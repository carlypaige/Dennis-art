    <h1>Letters And In Between</h1>
    <p>
      I am interested in what comes between a letter, a word an image- what
      connects and disconnects them. Searching for the obscure and some type of
      meaning: finding a way to question a word or phrase, dissecting letters to
      see no word, juxtaposing image/words to find something else- letters as
      abstract imagery. What are letters? What are words? What are phrases? What
      comes in between? What are the aesthetics and anti-aesthetics of the
      three? What happens when you add a visual to text? What happens when you
      add text to an image? Can you unread a word? I want the viewer to question
      a word. These questions and ideas are what I ponder when I make this
      series of work. Sometimes I go in with a specific idea or maybe a word.
      Sometimes I play with found letters, words, and images until I find
      something that makes sense or no sense to me visually or linguistically.
      Responding to graphic design and text- I find the comfort to make my most
      recent series of work. The format comes from studying graphic design early
      on in my college career. I never really abandoned the graphic art look
      from my work. I keep the basic format the same for cohesion of the group
      but that is as far as associations go with each piece. I want each piece
      to be specific and different in message, idea, or question. I am
      influenced by so many artists but want to find a “visual vocabulary” that
      is me. Some influences have been Jenny Holzer and Kameelah Janan Rasheed.
