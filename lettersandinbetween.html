      Letters and in between- I am interested in what comes between a letter, a
      word an image- what connects and disconnects them. Searching for the
      obscure and some type of meaning: finding a way to question a word or
      phrase, dissecting letters to see no word, juxtaposing image/words to find
      something else- letters as abstract imagery. What are letters? What are
      words? What are phrases? What comes in between? What are the aesthetics
      and anti-aesthetics of the three? What happens when you add a visual to
      text? What happens when you add text to an image? Can you unread a word? I
      want the viewer to question a word. These questions and ideas are what I
      ponder when I make this series of work. Sometimes I go in with a specific
      idea or maybe a word. Sometimes I play with found letters, words, and
      images until I find something that makes sense or no sense to me visually
      or linguistically. Responding to graphic design and text- I find the
      comfort to make my most recent series of work. The format comes from
      studying graphic design early on in my college career. I never really
      abandoned the graphic art look from my work. I keep the basic format the
      same for cohesion of the group but that is as far as associations go with
      each piece. I want each piece to be specific and different in message,
      idea, or question. I am influenced by so many artists but want to find a
      “visual vocabulary” that is me. Some influences have been- Jenny Holzer
      and Kameelah Janan Rasheed.
